# Smart Money ML Strategy

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based strategy for trading. The goal is to analyze market data, identify patterns, and make informed trading decisions using predictive models. Among various technical indicators, BOS - break of structure and CHOCH - change of character are used. Two boosting machine learning models are used for comparison: XGB and CatBoost.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing for financial markets.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for trading strategies.
- Backtesting and performance evaluation of strategies.

## Installation
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run main.py to fetch data, add indicators, train models and backtest.
2. Run separate scripts for the specific tasks.
